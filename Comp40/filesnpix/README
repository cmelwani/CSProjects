Helped that we received: 
- We've received help from TA's in Office Hours and lab
 over the past couple of weeks. 
- We've received help from the lectures (Megan and Richard)
as well as Q&A sessions to figure how to write this HW

What we implemented correctly: 
- We implemented brightness correctly, uisng the pnmrdr 
interface and reading in from both given files and stdin.
- We implemented simlines correctly such that the 
output matches that of the spec
- We implemented readaline correctly such that 
it follows the functions outlined by the spec. 

What we implemented wrongly: 
- We may have not caught all of the errors and accounted 
for all of the input files possible any of the parts of 
the HW.
- We could have added more testing files to our 
implementation so maybe we didn't catch specific
edge cases that the autograder might.
- We decided to implement the partial credit
version of readaline where the function only
can read up to lines of 200 characters. 
- We could definetely improve on the modularity of our
solution for simlines

How many hours we spent on this assignment: 
60 hours
