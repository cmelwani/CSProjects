 HW 2 (iii) created by Cheryl Melwani and Anna Wang
 
 Acknolwedgments: 
 - Noah Mendelson's brightness code posted on the COMP40 website
 under solutions was used to reorganize our sudoku.c and 
 unblackedges.c files. After seeing his example, we saw that his way 
 of getting and closing an input file is a lot more effecient than 
 the way we structured it. 
 - Byron and other TA's really helped us out! We couldn't have 
 finished this without them so big thanks to all of them for helping 
 us out. 
- Lectures and content from Megan and Richard helped throughout this 
process. 


What has been correctly implemented: 
- We believe we have correctly implemented Parts C and D. 
While there may be a more effecient program out there with better 
runtime and use of space, we have tested both programs and our 
program has succeeded all of our tests.
- We also used the tests outlined on the spec to make sure we 
followed directions and that our code was working well. 

What has not been correctly implemented: 
- However, we do understand that there are edge cases that we 
probably haven't taken care of and our program might fail on those 
edge cases in both Sudoku and unblackedges. 
- There is a lack of modularity and abstraction in some parts of our 
program and that happened due to a lack of time and ability to fully 
make the code as effecient as can be. 

How much time spent on the assignment: 
At least 40-50 hours
