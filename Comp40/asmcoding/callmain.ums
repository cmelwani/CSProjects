# Description: makes the initial call to main, then halts (all in the init    #
# section).                                                                   #

# Calling Conventions: 
# r0 is zero
# r1 is the return address register and the result register
# r6 and r7 are volatile and are normally .temps 

.section init 
    .temps r6, r7 
    .zero r0 
main:               # initial call to main to begin the program
    goto waiting    # go to waiting in calc40.ums
    halt
