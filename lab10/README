I'm doing this lab in order to:
- pass the time in pleasant company.
- understand what universal polymorphism is and how I can practically apply it.
- to avoid bad things that might happen if I don't do it.


How did universal polymorphism affect the implementation. Was it helpful?

Universal polymorphism is pretty much the idea that a template encompasses.
The ideas of universal polymorphism allows for the same functions to be used
on different data types. A template is a general outline of a class that
can be used with different data types as shown through lab10 and therefore
the idea encompasses what universal polymorphism is. Meaning it's not helpful
but pretty integral to the implementation of a template.
