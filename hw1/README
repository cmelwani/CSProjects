A. The title of the homework and the author's name (you)

hw1: Array Lists
Cheryl Melwani

B. The purpose of the program

The purpose of the program is to create a class produces a character array list
and has different functions that an array list would normally have.

C. Acknowledgements for any help you received

I received help from a Comp 15 TA and looked through Professor Sheldon's notes
and codes that he put up online. I worked through array list concepts with
friends outside of class.

D. The files that you provided and a short description of what each file is
and its purpose.

CharArrayList.h -> The h file contains the public and private functions and
variables of the class CharArrayList.
CharArrayList.cpp -> This file is the implementation of the public and private
functions declared in the .h file. All public and private functions are written
out in this file and private variables are accessed through getter functions.
The .h file is included in the .cpp file.
testCharArrayList.cpp -> This file is used to test all the functions written
in the CharArrayList.cpp file.

E. How to compile and run your program
clang++ -o CharArrayList -Wall -Wextra CharArrayList.cpp testCharArrayList.cpp
./CharArrayList

F. An outline of the data structures and algorithms that you used.
   Given that this is a data structures class, you always need to
   discuss the data structure that you used and justify why
   you used it.  Specifically for this assignment please
   discuss the features of arrays, major advantages and major
   disadvantages of utilizing an array list as you have in this
   assignment.  The algorithm overview may not be relevant
   depending on the assignment.

The data structure used in this assignment is an Array List. The major
advantage of an Array List is that you can constantly change the capacity and
therefore the size of the list. When the Array List exceeds its size, the
capacity will increase by 50%. Another advantage of an Array List is that you
can add elements and remove elements from any index along the array list.
However, a disadvantage is that once an element is removed from the Array list,
other data points need to shift since there can't be an empty index in an
Array List.

G. Details and an explanation of how you tested the various parts
   of assignment and the program as a whole. You may reference
   the testing files that you submitted to aid in your explanation.

The way I tested various parts of the assignment was through having a
corresponding test function for almost every function written in
CharArrayList.cpp. I created an instance of a CharArrayList as a global
variable and therefore could manipulated using the functions written in the
.cpp file to see if the functions were working or not. By inserting values
into the CharArrayList I created, I could test out all of the other functions
to see if they were working properly or not. Some functions, like the print
function, didn't have a corresponding test function since all other test
functions were required to use print.
