A. The title of the homework and the author's name (you)

hw2: Linked Lists
Cheryl Melwani

B. The purpose of the program

The purpose of the program is to create a class that produces a char linked list
and has different functions that carry out the operations of a linked list.

C. Acknowledgements for any help you received

I received help from two Comp 15 TA's during office hours and took the
assignment operator code from the labs we did this semester. I received help
from the Comp 15 TA's on aspects such as valgrind errors, and whether having a
curr_pos was necessary or not in my code. I also took a look at our make file
for lab to adjust mine for the homework. I also discussed concepts such as
how to test the constructors and assignment operators with friends outside of
class. I took my function contract comments from my hw1 and adjusted it for this
assignment. Furthermore, i got help online to figure out the try and catch
syntax to account for exceptions and edge cases in the program.

D. The files that you provided and a short description of what each file is
and its purpose.

CharLinkedList.h -> The h file contains the public and private functions and
variables of the class CharLinkedList.
CharLinkedList.cpp -> This file is the implementation of the public and private
functions declared in the .h file. All public and private functions are written
out in this file and private variables are accessed through getter functions.
The .h file is included in the .cpp file.
testCharArrayList.cpp -> This file is used to test all the functions written
in the CharLinkedList.cpp file.

E. How to compile and run your program
Compile:
1. clang++ -o CharLinkedList -Wall -Wextra CharLinkedList.cpp
testCharLinkedList.cpp
2. make
Run:
./CharArrayList

F. An outline of the data structures and algorithms that you used.
   Given that this is a data structures class, you always need to
   discuss the data structure that you used and justify why
   you used it.  Specifically for this assignment please
   discuss the features of arrays, major advantages and major
   disadvantages of utilizing an array list as you have in this
   assignment.  The algorithm overview may not be relevant
   depending on the assignment.

The data structure used in this assignment is a Doubly Linked List. The major
advantage of a doubly linked list is that you can traverse back and forth using
the previous and next pointers. Furthermore, when you remove an element or a
node inside the linked list, you don't need to shift anything but rather
just make sure the pointers before and after the node being removed are
updated. However, to some this may seem as a disadvantage. Additionally,
the length of the linked list constantly updates rather than it being a
fixed size.

G. Details and an explanation of how you tested the various parts
   of assignment and the program as a whole. You may reference
   the testing files that you submitted to aid in your explanation.

The way I tested various parts of the assignment was through having a
corresponding test function for almost every function written in
CharLinkedList.cpp. I created an instance of a CharLinkedList in each
of my test functions to manipulate it as needed, so I could test each
function as I write it in a simple way. I inserted elements into every
test function to then manipulate it as needed. I also tested the constructers
and the assignment operator to make sure it was working.
Some functions, like the print function, didn't have a corresponding test
function since all other test functions were required to use print. I
accounted for exceptions as I wrote down the functions and used the try and
catch keyword to account for these exceptions in my test file. The one 
thing I would change for next homework is to run with valgrind after I
think i'm finished with a function, rather than running valgrind once I'm
done with the program.
